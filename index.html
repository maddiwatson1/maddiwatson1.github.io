<div id="about">

  <p> At a young age, I had found a strong passion for pencil illustrations. In high school I had explored all kinds of mediums for the artwork I created and found myself leaning back towards pencil drawings. Oddly enough, I never thought I'd go to school for graphic design and become a designer.</p>

	<p>Come 2014 I will be receiving my graphic design diploma and will be out in the real world. As a student and freelance designer, I have gained a lot of knowledge in all aspects of design and hope to become a logo and layout designer in the future.</p>
    
    <p>I assure you that I will do my best to stay on top of updating my site to fill all of you in on current and upcoming projects. Although, you're all probably better off by clicking on one of the three links below.</p>
